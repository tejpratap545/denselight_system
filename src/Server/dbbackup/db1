However, due to lack of intern or a 3rd headcount to establish and ensure continuity of this system, the project was placed on hold. There was no or very low application for an IE internship when it was posted. Next steps was to build a Job Description for a full time junior IE/IT role. The justification for this needs more thoughts to fill up the executive time fruitfully for 40-45 hrs a work week, and building more projects to accommodate this will be the key next step.\r\n                                              \r\nKFA 4.1 - WIP management thru ODOO was a success story and though there are many nicks along the way, it was overcame diligently.

Traveller sheet has been re-designed, the sun-con invoice details is underway plus a few more milestones needs to be established before this goes life. A lot of time and resources has been used as a concerted effort to get this going, and once system wise ready, the journey will be to internalize the the new way of going things which is inline with the i4.0 where productivity thru automation replaces manual way of executing non value added jobs. \r\n\r\nKFA4.3 - Led by Nee Shiuan and he's on track with all his automation projects which by and large needs the expertise of PE\r\n\r\nBi Weekly Meeting has been setup with the President and CEO with the Head of Supply Chain to run thru the key projects and the deliverables in line with the company's objectives.

173	For SLED, the challenge is the high mix-low vol nature of the product family, therefore, yield needs to manage by product family sharing the same Epi/chip design and process flow. \r\n\r\nThough most of the yield improvement actions were planned before Xiaoyu joined, xiaoyu picked up very fast, and he can carried out analysis independently most of time and provide direction for yield improvement.

176	Upon receiving the task, xiaoyu was still relatively new in DSL, but he still went into details on the market report, and put in extra effort to search and consolidate BW information btw DSL and key competitors, which greatly helped the management team to see the super bandwidth opportunity in 1310nm wavelength range in OCT market.	2020-12-02 12:35:17.249601+05:30	\N	861437177	465	265
177	Ronaldo joined DSL with strong test and programming background, which can greatly help DSL to enable a lot of test capability setup inhouse, test automation or semi-automation for UPH and cycle time improvement, as well as engineering work efficiency improve through many small scripts to speed up the data collection & compilation. \r\n\r\nTo make full use of his skillset, Ronaldo needs to establish a broader & long term view on how to integrate the scattered efforts from each function, and integrate them into a synchronized direction. This is one level higher than what he is supporting today.	2020-12-02 12:55:04.606489+05:30	\N	861437177	460	265
178	Ronaldo's strength is the quick data pulling and consolidation, and ensure data accuracy. On this perspective, Ronaldo is probably the fastest among all PE engineers. However, his weakness is on putting up the data in a logical order with good story line. Many time, he tends to focus very much on one particular piece of data, and forget to let management team knows the big picturial view and how is that data link to this picture and direction. \r\n\r\nSecondly, on the low SMSR yield troubleshooting, Ronaldo has not yet shown his ability to deep dive into the grating profile to the SMSR yield. To do that, Ronaldo needs to expose more & learn the analytical skills in making correlation of test yield to Epi structure, Wafer fab process & parameters and x-SEM etc.	2020-12-02 13:20:07.848387+05:30	\N	861437177	456	265
179	To enable the smooth transfer, Ronaldo needs to study through the phase gate meaning and checklist in details, understand the requirement to exit each phase gate, and define list of outstanding actions that NPD needs to close by each phase gate. Also, basic program management skill training has been provided to him to help him handle this project.	2020-12-02 13:28:08.992285+05:30	\N	861437177	458	265

189	A. Create a 100% goal-oriented and task-driven focused organization by introducing disruptive 1310 CW 70mW @70C product compared to the competitors by Q4'20 \r\n1. a. 1310 70mW@75C has been achieved by 500um (19141A). However, the die was not working as a DFB at 25C\r\n   b. 1310 70mW@75C has been achieved by 1000um (20132A). The previous issue has been eliminated by proper grating design and now die is showing DFB performance from 25C - 75C. However, due to high induced temp. die is misbehaving after 300mA driving current\r\nc. Few more wafers are in line to show the improvement in performance\r\n\r\nB. All technical internal audit has been carried out and helped NPD to process through Audit check.	2020-12-03 15:33:04.249536+05:30	\N	539619816	448	312
193	ELED test yield is mainly dominated by unstable and high variation of ripple yield loss. Team was working in parallel on variation control by identifying toggling factors like test, ridge etch profile etc, as well as laser chip design optimization (by adopting the SLED absorber & tapered ridge design). Carlan was working proactively and diligently on both paths. He was also learning by OJT on process & design factors toggling ripple.	2020-12-07 12:28:38.901971+05:30	\N	861437177	342	265
200	Despite the heavy work load & pressure to recover back ELED yield while Carlan newly took over from Hafiz in May, Carlan stayed very positive and showed strong sense of ownership on these NPD/NRE project. For 1650nm FP laser, two customers engaged, and 10 samples order received as of Dec'20.  For OSI, 1310nm bulk design passed the customer's power and back reflection spec, but 1550nm need to re-design the bulk Epi structure to meet the power spec	2020-12-09 08:20:39.881955+05:30	\N	861437177	344	265
201	However, the “proactive” mindset still needs to enhance as part of working culture change needs for PE team especially on revenue support, as many times PE support were constrained by the mindset and way-of-working from PPC & supply chain (e.g the new epi growth needs, inventory status, PO status & gap, PE needs to proactively trigger PPC to share and make decision accordingly)	2020-12-09 08:22:43.683315+05:30	\N	861437177	472	265
202	1. Something commendable about Carlan is his leadership potential. Through the training of new staff, Carlan demonstrated a very good coaching skills by explaining things in a logical order, and easy for others to understand & hands on. Carlan also has the potential to see big picture, and put his insights in sharing knowledge and project direction with his big pictorial view. \r\n2. Through the training to sales team, it can also see that Carlan did a lot of home work to package him with strong technical background and understanding on ELED and SLED.	2020-12-09 08:24:07.477871+05:30	\N	861437177	473	265
203	Carlan is strong in data analysis and technical issue troubleshooting, and has been working extensively with MOCVD team and hafiz previously on SLED Epi structure optimization for Power/BW and yield improvement. He also worked aggressively on ELED chip design optimization for ripple baseline improvement. Carlan not only focus on data analysis, but would also deep dive into the technical background and mechanism to link or support the Epi or chip design improvement direction and test data validation. This is very good, and as he is gaining more & more experience and knowledge on design & process factors impact to test parameters, he will surely improve his efficiency on problem solving moving forward.	2020-12-09 08:25:09.731375+05:30	\N	861437177	343	265

209	Despite the economy downturns. I have contributed to bring in $350k revenue to the company for winning the business with Polytech. \r\nThough this will not happen this year due to the long lead time of the components but its already a deliverables for next year.	2020-12-10 09:24:47.461394+05:30	\N	1014312820	172	329
205	1. Being the previous owner for DFB 16xx, and also the original owner who drove the Almae yield from 20% to 70% level through the grating profile optimization, Zuhdi has taken up the SMSR yield improvement role again when he joined back DSL in Aug’20. \r\n2. His analytical skills and knowledge in opto-electronics has fully demonstrated in this assignment, and he can do technical deep diving, create logical link to the big data base, and is able to filter noise data and guide management team to the right direction for improvement. This is clearly a strong area I observed on Zuhdi. He should keep it up and utilize his strength in other job assignment on technical issue troubleshooting and data analysis.	2020-12-09 13:39:31.67883+05:30	\N	861437177	351	265
194	1) Have shipped a number of BF9C box with linewidth lower than 50Khz for samples. NPD still working on the 10khz versions. \r\n\r\n2) For panwoo, we have actually packaged successful BTF units with AFR and sent samples to customer. Now we are in the optimization phase to get better yield wafers and to increase the power.	2020-12-07 12:35:36.261017+05:30	\N	973701598	295	271
195	1. Baseline SoWs have all been generated. Approval processes in progress.\r\n2. Yields - 90% yields seen generally for high runner production parts. Yield for FBGL is fluactuting partly due to engineering uncertainties. SFO still has low yield in ILM boxes.\r\n3. CT improved to 3 weeks at Allray and 4 weeks at SFO. Coset is 4-5 weeks, PMS is >6 weeks due mostly to FBGL yield issues.\r\n4. Qualification is done. Yield is >90% based on small sample sizes.\r\n5. Hisense documentation and test correlation are ready however manufacturing has not started due to no sale of parts yet.\r\n6. AFR identified as alternative subcon for 8-pin and 14-p[in FBGL lasers and already used as supplier for engineering parts. Full qualification for production parts in-progress. ELED TO Can suppliers have not been found but put on-hold since Allray can support full volume at the moment.	2020-12-08 13:21:20.364508+05:30	\N	50985924	173	295

199	1. Closed 3 RMAs with average 21 days cycle time. Met the 30 days target set by QA.\r\n2. Closed 7 NCMRs for ELED/SLED with average 77 days cycle time. Higher than 30 days target, but this is comparable to other department.\r\n3. Many of PE NCMR is low yield wafers, and yield target was set too high to trigger NCMR, PE has worked with QA to re-set the yield target to reflect the true yield performance & low yield triggering point.	2020-12-09 08:18:36.817507+05:30	\N	861437177	471	265

213	1. Firstly, as one of the previous ILM Box owner, Zuhdi picked up very fast and rendered adequately good support to ensure the timely revenue shipment. Secondly, the ILM Box way of working and ownership is quite messy before NPD transfer ownership to PE. Despites the daily “surprises” here and there, Zuhdi is proactively taking up ownership to link up all broken pieces together to back fill the gaps.\r\n2. Overall, Zuhdi has the knowledge and deep diving ability on challenging technical issues. Moving forward, if Zuhdi can further improve in the ability to do multi-tasking, that will be even better for his own growth & development as well as creating more values to the PE team.	2020-12-10 10:45:11.322234+05:30	\N	861437177	355	265
215	Internally, the plan to re-layout APT to support the revenue ramp has been completed . \r\nAs a result, it reduces the distance travelled by operator from one workstation to another by 56% as test and assembly are already in the same area. By using the IE tool such as relationship diagram the relevant/related workstations are shifted near with each other which is also a factor in improvement process.\r\nThe progress of adhering to the proposed layout is currently at 95% progress.	2020-12-10 10:49:57.763599+05:30	\N	1014312820	167	329
216	1. There are still many unknown technical issues on NLW laser, COS to module process interaction, as well as COS & module to box assembly process interaction.\r\n2. Moving forward, in terms of PE resources, there is plan for another FBGL module/ILM box PE head count to be hired, and Zuhdi needs to coach and guide him/her on the ILM box related problem solving. The goal is to ultimately establish clear understanding on the various technical issues to ensure smooth production ramp, on time customer delivery and good quality products.	2020-12-10 11:02:20.982401+05:30	\N	861437177	369	265
214	Had already fulfilled the required number of headcount in APT for 1H of 2020 based on the actual APT loading. However, in 2H onwards I am no longer directly involve in APT headcount.\r\nAlthough, I have built up a model to determine the number of headcount required based on demand/forecast which can help the supervisor to determine the requirement.	2020-12-10 10:45:27.617336+05:30	\N	1014312820	177	329
217	With his data management background, Zuhdi hands on very fast after he re-joined back DSL. He has clear direction how to drive the individual database infrastructure, and bring all different blocks together. What he needs to learn moving forward is how to utilize higher management power to help him drive the work at the working level. It’s inevitably in a working place, many people need the top-down force to deliver tasks, especially areas not in their priority. It’s part of self-growing process that Zuhdi needs to learn.	2020-12-10 11:48:41.376446+05:30	\N	861437177	354	265
218	Again, with Zuhdi’s knowledge and experience in data management system, and in particular his past experience in partnering with Pointstar, Zuhdi contributed valuable inputs to guide the management team to negotiate on the software deliverables and make the right decision. Project was delayed few months due to some server migration issue at the vendor side, and now is back on track to launch by end of 2020.	2020-12-10 12:03:29.839404+05:30	\N	861437177	353	265
219	So far only one internal working meeting between Zuhdi and other PE engineers to deep dive into the simulation tool, need mid-long term plan to slowly establish the simulation capability within PE team. If need external support, let's put down the requirements as well.	2020-12-10 12:07:47.211541+05:30	\N	861437177	357	265

220	Done research and benchmarking on other renowned semiconductor companies around the globe to understand and more importantly, execute the Kaizen projects with results. \r\nThe mainframe has been created and presented to management during the Operational Excellence reviews. However, due to lack of intern or a 3rd headcount to establish and ensure continuity of this system, the project was placed on hold. There was no or very low application for an IE internship when it was posted. Next steps was to build a Job Description for a full time junior IE/IT role. The justification for this needs more thoughts to fill up the executive time fruitfully for 40-45 hrs a work week, and building more projects to accommodate this will be the key next step.\r\n                                              \r\nKFA 4.1 - WIP management thru ODOO was a success story and though there are many nicks along the way, it was overcame diligently. This road to fully cross between APT (Assy) to Fab B (Coating) back to APT (Assy and Test) right thru SubCon and back again to APT in various product form takes time to be developed inside the Odoo system. Traveller sheet has been re-designed, the sun-con invoice details is underway plus a few more milestones needs to be established before this goes life. A lot of time and resources has been used as a concerted effort to get this going, and once system wise ready, the journey will be to internalize the the new way of going things which is inline with the i4.0 where productivity thru automation replaces manual way of executing non value added jobs. \r\n\r\nKFA4.3 - Led by Nee Shiuan and he's on track with all his automation projects which by and large needs the expertise of PE\r\n\r\nBi Weekly Meeting has been setup with the President and CEO with the Head of Supply Chain to run thru the key projects and the deliverables in line with the company's objectives.	2020-12-10 12:25:01.810857+05:30	\N	1982477965	298	266

This is not only limited to WIP profile, but also as aging WIP, Queue time pareto by tool type, and many other customizable charts and trends for analysis.\r\n\r\nTraveler has has been added into Odoo as opposed to hard copy. Invoicing thru Odoo for sub con and tracking is currently underway. \r\n\r\nSo far, the ODOO system is a working solution but is only 65%-70% completed. This journey will be part of a continuous improvement item where the sky will be the limit as new and improved solutions becomes available over time. The last 15%-20% will be the toughest as it will link up the overall structure from W/O release till shipment and linking materials and sub-con as a whole WIP management solution,	2020-12-10 13:52:10.794233+05:30	\N	1982477965	297	266

252	As the key person building up PE database, Jaslyn's main focus was on improving the timeliness of ELED/SLED database in TIBCO, as this is extremely important to enable real time product test issue troubleshooting and engineering data characterization and analysis. For this project, Jaslyn is supporting Carlan on the Autobar station database enhancement. Moving forward, Jaslyn should take more initiative to understand the database needs from PE end users (all the product owners), and come out strategical plan to improve database integrity and timeliness. She should also work proactively to drive other functions (like APT) to improve data accuracy & speed on data readiness in TIBCO.	2020-12-14 10:23:25.485394+05:30	\N	861437177	136	265
253	Jaslyn is new to yield reporting system and yield management system. For 2020, Jacquelyn was leading the effort to establish ELED, SLED process flow, established & aligned the integral yield calculation model, and guidelines on managing the yield  data, while Jaslyn is supporting Jacquelyn to pull the data, follow the yield model to do weekly yield reporting. Moving forward in 2021, as Jaslyn is now familiar with the yield management system concept, she needs to put more thought process, and give her insights how to improve the yield reporting system, and strategy to incorporate more new products going to release into production next year.	2020-12-14 11:05:41.35416+05:30	\N	861437177	137	265
254	Again Jaslyn is new to the yield management & yield dashboard. Main effort led by Jacquelyn with the rest of PE and Subbu to establish the yield dashboard template. As Jaslyn holds a role on PE data management system/improvement, her role is critical and also linked tightly with the yield reporting & management. Therefore, the expection to her is to demonstrate more initiative & drive to contribute on the strategical plan and road map on yield management system moving forward. Today, she is working as a supporting role mainly.	2020-12-14 11:35:39.727781+05:30	\N	861437177	482	265
255	I would say from Q1-Q3’20, PE product engineers were still struggling pretty much to ask for “case-by-case” basis on the data readiness in TIBCO for weekly yield analysis, engineering DOE and issue troubleshooting, as there are weeks delay on the data readiness in TIBCO. Situation improved in earlier Q4’20 with more structural way to review and highlight the gaps in database system. Now the data readiness gap improved to be within 24hrs.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, expectation for Jaslyn as the key person on data management system, needs to drive the database gap by proactively working with PE product owners, understand the big pictorial view of database future direction, and come out breakthrough ideas, improvement plan and drive all parties to bring the whole database system to the next level.	2020-12-14 12:02:58.002001+05:30	\N	861437177	483	265

300	1. ELED: overall CBT test yield capability improved by ~5% looking at the monthly trend from 2019 to 2020: best yielding month is at 72.1%, while the best yield month for 2020 is at 77.3%; However the yield is not stable mainly due to poor design margin for ripple. Yield trended low in Q1 and Q3, and managed to recover back to ~75% level in Q4’20. \r\n\r\n1.1\t By quarter performance:\r\n•\tQ1 = 13 wafers (27,765 dies) tested, avg yield = 65.1%\r\n•\tQ2 = 17 wafers (28, 753 dies) tested, avg yiled = 77.7%\r\n•\tQ3 = 18 wafers (24,716 dies) tested, avg yield = 71.5%\r\n•\tQ4 QTD: 20 wafers tested avg yield = 75.2%\r\n•\tQ4 met the 75% ELED/SLED cum yield target with ELED yield on 53084H/3036H normalized to 54708T.\r\n\r\n1.2 Record yield:\r\n1. Record yielding wafer is 20023B with 87% CBT test yield from Samco etcher in Q3.\r\n2. Record yielding week is wk17 at 84.1% with 2829 dies tested.\r\n3. Stably recovered the ELED CBT test yield back to 79.6% after flushing out Oxford & tester issue with total 5351 dies tested.\r\n\r\n1.3\tNo record of mis-shipment for first half of 2020.\r\n\r\n2.\tSLED: \r\n•\tQ1: CBT: 50.1%/COS: 85.1% -> CBT*COS: 42.6%: CBT (14 wfrs); COS: (19 wfrs)\r\n•\tQ2: CBT: 89.3%/COS:91.5% -> CBT*COS: 81.7%: CBT (11 wfrs); COS: (17 wfrs)\r\n•\tQ3: CBT: 82.8%/COS:79..5% -> CBT*COS: 65.8%: CBT (5 wfrs); COS: (13 wfrs)\r\n\r\n2.1 Not meeting yield target of 87.5% (CBT*COS). To meet the yield goal Need further improvement on power and bandwidth on weaker products and flushing out the old low yield wafers. \r\n2.2 The quarter to quarter yield variation comes from different products loading with different yield capability. \r\n2.3 Yield improvement plan:\r\n- CS5153A family: bandwidth improvement through SCH thin down from 50nm to 40nm; lead wafer on 5153A new Epi QW design showed promising BW & power results meeting the product spec. \r\n- CS68M5A: key challenge is to hit the +/-10nm wavelength range, while no capability current at this wavelength range to measure PL. Started 3 wafers with PL, PL+10nm, PL-10nm to enable cherry pick units for this +/-10nm wavelength spec. \r\n-  CS5169A family: latest wafer (20041A) copied the golden wafer (19070A) EPI scheme, but power still fail, and is likely related to wafer broken (20041A) and Samco etcher (30% lower power compared to Oxford), need to monitor more wafer.\r\n- Wavelength centering CS68M5A, first wafer 16086A PL off target >15nm, fine tuning for potential requirement.\r\n- CS 5169A-FA: need to grow new epi wafer with 45nm SCH (to improve power) + wavelength centering.\r\n- CS3504A/CS3452A family: grown new Epi wafer based on golden wafer 14069A Epi scheme. Pending test results.\r\n\r\n3. DFB16xx: no production volume on DFB16xx as sales has yet to engage any successful customers yet. Overall, total 8 wafers tested for Q1~Q3, overall average yield is 38.6%. Excluding one wafer hit by RTP excursion, the average yield is 43.1%.\r\n• Almae: 3 wafers (excluding RTP affected wafer) is at 49%\r\n• Eulitha: 4 wafers is at 38.8%.\r\nDidn't meet the yield target for both Almae and Eulitha. However, direction is clear to further improve the SMSR yield. Pending lead wafer on 20nm grating thickness to confirm.  \r\n\r\nNew technical learnings/breakthrough:\r\n• Almae: altogether 3 wafers with optimum grating design (30nm grating height) yielded ~69% in average from Q2 & Q3. Yield is very consistent.\r\n• Eulitha: so far only two wafers tested, best yielding wafer is at 63% with 30nm grating height. Expect yield will be even better with 20nm Grating height by Q4. \r\n• Established the correlation of Kappa-L to SMSR yield with Kappa-L > 3, SMSR yield will drop to below 40% level. Waiting for more data out to establish the Kappa-L sweet spot.  \r\n• Established capability & automate the multi-current SMSR testing.  \r\n• Established testing methodology for bar test and packaged TOCAN with TEC	2020-12-15 13:01:00.053368+05:30	\N	861437177	28	265

Database enhancement:\r\n• Manual Station Auto logging in Database (Fairoz): Software is updated, pending implementation due to movement of manual stations to cleaving area. \r\n• Auto-bar station (Jaslyn/Ken): done\r\n• Rajan requested to enable Fittech data to directly upload in SQL: APT is working on it\r\n5. Yield reporting structure & yield management system:\r\n• Established the APT process flow, proposed and finalized the yield calculation methodology, defined a list of criterias for first version of integral yield calculation model for ELED & SLED in wk10'20. \r\n• Aligned cross-functionally with APT on the APT process yield target and test yield targets in Mar'20.\r\n• Optimized the yield calculation model by taking out non DLS processes and non-yield off step, and recalibrated the test yield target based on 75% cum yield goal in wk28'20.\r\n• Segregated SLED to update the yield by product family on a monthly basis based on it's high mix low vol nature.\r\n• Established the yield reporting framework & ILM BOX flow, and triggerd to kick off ILM BOX yield update by CBT/COS (PE), Module (external manufacturing) and BOX (APT process) in Oct'20.	2020-12-15 13:04:19.277722+05:30	\N	861437177	29	265
302	1. 25G DML: project delayed ~ 1Q from NPD, and is now in Alpha cum Beta -phase exit review now. Very limited engineering data collected, though data showed capability to meet the product spec with ~50% integral yield, more statistical data needed to fully prove the feasibility in Gamma phase.\r\n2. 25G DML is the first program going through PDM process. As Alpha/beta phase exit is not done yet, FMEA/ORT is not ready yet. \r\n3.
