To meet the yield goal Need further improvement on power and bandwidth on weaker products and flushing out the old low yield wafers. \r\n2.2 The quarter to quarter yield variation comes from different products loading with different yield capability. \r\n2.3 Yield improvement plan:\r\n- CS5153A family: bandwidth improvement through SCH thin down from 50nm to 40nm; lead wafer on 5153A new Epi QW design showed promising BW & power results meeting the product spec. \r\n- CS68M5A: key challenge is to hit the +/-10nm wavelength range, while no capability current at this wavelength range to measure PL. Started 3 wafers with PL, PL+10nm, PL-10nm to enable cherry pick units for this +/-10nm wavelength spec. \r\n-  CS5169A family: latest wafer (20041A) copied the golden wafer (19070A) EPI scheme, but power still fail, and is likely related to wafer broken (20041A) and Samco etcher (30% lower power compared to Oxford), need to monitor more wafer.\r\n- Wavelength centering CS68M5A, first wafer 16086A PL off target >15nm, fine tuning for potential requirement.\r\n- CS 5169A-FA: need to grow new epi wafer with 45nm SCH (to improve power) + wavelength centering.\r\n- CS3504A/CS3452A family: grown new Epi wafer based on golden wafer 14069A Epi scheme. Pending test results.\r\n\r\n3. DFB16xx: no production volume on DFB16xx as sales has yet to engage any successful customers yet. Overall, total 8 wafers tested for Q1~Q3, overall average yield is 38.6%. Excluding one wafer hit by RTP excursion, the average yield is 43.1%.\r\n• Almae: 3 wafers (excluding RTP affected wafer) is at 49%\r\n• Eulitha: 4 wafers is at 38.8%.\r\nDidn't meet the yield target for both Almae and Eulitha. However, direction is clear to further improve the SMSR yield.

Yield is very consistent.\r\n• Eulitha: so far only two wafers tested, best yielding wafer is at 63% with 30nm grating height. Expect yield will be even better with 20nm Grating height by Q4. \r\n• Established the correlation of Kappa-L to SMSR yield with Kappa-L > 3, SMSR yield will drop to below 40% level. Waiting for more data out to establish the Kappa-L sweet spot.  \r\n• Established capability & automate the multi-current SMSR testing.  \r\n• Established testing methodology for bar test and packaged TOCAN with TEC	Both ELED and SLED missed target yields. Need yield improvement (ripple, BW, pwr) and demonstrate in Q1'21 with new absorber design.	3	1	1	Weighted integral yield for ELED and SLED met 75% yield goal in Q4'20. Integral yield is still mainly dominated by ELED as the major volume runner. Yield met target partly due to flushing out of ripple excursion materials (e.g Samco III-V etcher and tester issue), as well as the good ripple improvement from new chip design (500um Active length, tapered ridge & new absorber design).\n\nFor SLED, the team successfully regrow new Epi wafer to meet product performance on high vol runner product family 3159A, 5153A, 51010-T20/ASE and FBGL chip 5101B-S1550; for product family 5169A/5169A-FA and 3452A, new growth wafers are affected by low power issue likely related to PCO attack excursion and Samco etcher. New wafer growth to channel to Oxford etcher is ongoing to check the power performance.	NIL	NIL	null		161	861437177	4	APPROVED	For SLED (CBT*COS) and ELED (CBT only) test yield goal, both were derived from 75% cum yield goal set since Q4 2019 by previous PE management. The difference on the yield target is due to different APT flow (SLED has more steps and two test steps, while ELED has much shorter APT flow with only CBT test).	\N

Being the previous owner for DFB 16xx, and also the original owner who drove the Almae yield from 20% to 70% level through the grating profile optimization, Zuhdi has taken up the SMSR yield improvement role again when he joined back DSL in Aug’20. \r\n2. His analytical skills and knowledge in opto-electronics has fully demonstrated in this assignment, and he can do technical deep diving, create logical link to the big data base, and is able to filter noise data and guide management team to the right direction for improvement. This is clearly a strong area I observed on Zuhdi. He should keep it up and utilize his strength in other job assignment on technical issue troubleshooting and data analysis.	3	1	1	The Kappa-L to SMSR relationship has been established and clear direction of design has been established. We have reached SMSR Yield >80% already. We just need to shift the wavelength a little bit due to smaller grating size that affect the whole effective refractive index	NIL	NIL	null	SMSR_vs_Kappa-L.JPG	252	10	3	APPROVED	The SMSR yield of 81% has been achieved by having grating thickness of 20nm. However there is another unexpected problem that causing the wavelength to be shifted to the left side hence causing the PWL yield to be 0%. The problem is still under investigation	The 75% Almae and 60% Eulitha yield goal is set by bench marking mature products ELED/SLED and the gap between Almae and Eulitha based on existing data at the time.

122	Cycle time and rework reductions, Cost reductions for ebeam	1) Improve cycle time by reducing as less holds in the run sheets as possible\r\n2) Develop the process by which low rework rate will be achieved\r\n3) eBeam passes reduction and convergence	2020-12-31	20	Cycle time, rework and cost reductions	1) Cycle time improvement : Currently, all production, short loop run sheets are being created using DMES to reduce the cycle time. Furthermore, Litho and Etch recipes are created at critical steps where wafers are being hold for engineers. Deep trench processes which need special recipes for Ebeam, PLT and SMR, SOO and Samco etch recipes for RID, ZST have been created and wafers are running.\r\n2) Cost and rework rate reduction: Reworks are being avoided by creating the proper recipes and communicating with engineers and clear remarks in the run sheets.\r\n3) eBeam passes reduction and convergence: Engineering data collection has been completed. Pending to buy off whether it can be implemented in the production wafer first.	1) We still need to work on reducing holds once we run more wafers and move towards production transfer. DMES conversion has been done well. In the future, DMES templates need to be prepared early and tested if possible to reduce potential delays during execution.\r\n2) Runsheet remarks are good. We can improve communication with module engineers in advance before the wafer reaches the hold. Some form of FMEA or risk mitigation may be good to prevent situations where rework is required.\r\n3) We should expedite this as eBeam cost are quite significant.	4	2	1	1) Cycle time improvement : Currently, NATU, production and short loop run sheets are being executed using DMES systems to reduce the cycle time. Run sheet cycle time is significantly reduced to 30-45mins. Furthermore, Litho and Etch recipes were substituted at critical steps where previously wafers were being hold for engineers. Now, operators are using those recipes successfully and wafers are no longer waiting for engineers to execute including  their weekends and off-days. Examples: Deep trench processes which need special recipes for Ebeam, PLT and SMR, SOO and Samco etch recipes for RID, ZST have been created and wafers are running. \n2) Cost and rework rate reduction: One of the bottleneck processes which needed 100% reworks is the plating processes for DEINO wafers. By qualifying the 15nXT processes, current rework rate is reduced to zero (0 out of 11 passes). \n3) eBeam passes reduction and convergence: Engineering data collection has been completed. Proposed to POET whether NATU wafers can use thinner PML ebeam Au. Pending POET to confirm.        \n4) Wet Etch process developments:\n(a) By monitoring dummy InP etch rate before processing actual POET wafers, Almae BH HME process is currently processed by operators independently and it reduced at least 1 day cycle time. Previously, this process was performed by babysitting with operators.\n(b) 25G PBE SION (POET) and SIO2  (DLS) wet etch processes are currently being independently performed by operators without babysitting. 1 day cycle time is reduced.	Cycle Time: Our On Time Delivery is not good and will remain as a main KPI for 2021 PMP. While I understand there are other factors (Eqmt/Mfg) that also contribute, we need to do more to improve it. Good job on reducing the holds. For 2021, let's progress further by working with others, e.g. with Module to reduce rework and with MFG to accurately forecast cycle time and reduce delays.

Continuous learning and apply the learning on the new projects I will undertake (25G and Low DOP SLEDs)	Ronaldo's strength is the quick data pulling and consolidation, and ensure data accuracy. On this perspective, Ronaldo is probably the fastest among all PE engineers. However, his weakness is on putting up the data in a logical order with good story line. Many time, he tends to focus very much on one particular piece of data, and forget to let management team knows the big picturial view and how is that data link to this picture and direction. \r\n\r\nSecondly, on the low SMSR yield troubleshooting, Ronaldo has not yet shown his ability to deep dive into the grating profile to the SMSR yield. To do that, Ronaldo needs to expose more & learn the analytical skills in making correlation of test yield to Epi structure, Wafer fab process & parameters and x-SEM etc.	1	1	1	NIL	NIL	NIL	null		217	1484926575	3	APPROVED	Consistent reporting of DFB Program for the management and tracking the work orders, inventory and customer engagement (solo from Feb to May as taken over from Chai Hong).

I would say from Q1-Q3’20, PE product engineers were still struggling pretty much to ask for “case-by-case” basis on the data readiness in TIBCO for weekly yield analysis, engineering DOE and issue troubleshooting, as there are weeks delay on the data readiness in TIBCO. Situation improved in earlier Q4’20 with more structural way to review and highlight the gaps in database system. Now the data readiness gap improved to be within 24hrs.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, expectation for Jaslyn as the key person on data management system, needs to drive the database gap by proactively working with PE product owners, understand the big pictorial view of database future direction, and come out breakthrough ideas, improvement plan and drive all parties to bring the whole database system to the next level.	1	1	1	NIL	NIL	NIL	null		225	1256890838	5	APPROVED	\N	PE Database needs to be real time and error free, the manpower saving is on the engineering resource savings related to the prevention of manual data pulling, data filtering, data integrity check etc.

Next is to be able to connect these database into one platform. These mentioned capability is critical in every problem solving and efficiency of addressing problems is highly dependent on the availability of data.	Carlan is strong in data analysis and technical issue troubleshooting, and has been working extensively with MOCVD team and hafiz previously on SLED Epi structure optimization for Power/BW and yield improvement. He also worked aggressively on ELED chip design optimization for ripple baseline improvement. Carlan not only focus on data analysis, but would also deep dive into the technical background and mechanism to link or support the Epi or chip design improvement direction and test data validation. This is very good, and as he is gaining more & more experience and knowledge on design & process factors impact to test parameters, he will surely improve his efficiency on problem solving moving forward.	1	1	1	NIL	NIL	NIL	null		169	1352141850	4	APPROVED	\N	\N

Data from QA. \r\n\r\n2. Cost down:\r\n• With the hiring of one AE under SG#united pgm, the PE engineer’s working efficiency improved 10~20% from logistic (e.g. raising WO), documentation (data sheet clean up), new data sheet creation & hands on (test/VI inspection) support.\r\n• In terms of data system, this year PE team is still struggling pretty much on manual data pulling and consolidation due to data delay into TIBCO in Q1~Q3, Q4 showed some improvement from weeks delay to within 24hrs. \r\n• PDMS: project delayed few months due to vendor server change issue, UAT is in progress and first launch target in Dec’20.\r\n• For DFB, the test correlation with vendor (Hisense) is fully established and in-house sampling test.	PE team is following closely on RMA and NCMR cases. Need to push Fab team to inform them of any major issues upfront.	3	1	1	Overall, RMA/NCMR/CONC all consistently improved by ~40%. On top of closely follow up on every RMA & NCMR case, the continuous effort to fill the execution and system gap also counted for the consistent improvement this year.\n\nOn cost down side, year 2020 PE team hired one AE and one intern timely that significantly helped the PE engrs improve their efficiency by 10~20%. Moving forward, continuously get interns will be an alternative cost saving path for PE resource & work load management if the current AE decide to leave after one year traineeship. For PDMS system go live, there were some delay from Pointstar (serve migration), as well as DLS ownership change &  gap (from Hafiz to Zuhdi). The launch will delay by about two months from end Dec'20 to Feb'21. For the real-time database in TIBCO, there is still delay mainly due to skillset gap & efficiency issue from Jaslyn.

174	So far xiaoyu has completed 4 SFO & 3 AFR sample test, and concluded AFR has better response time (meeting 4s spec) and power stability is also better than SFO.\r\n\r\nXiaoyu: please put down hypothesis and action plan to validate the hypothesis on worse power stability on SFO samples (given the scenario that we win Eloira NRE business and need to qualify SFO)	2020-12-02 06:53:12.290302+00	861437177	462
175	Closed  3 RMAs with average 21 days cycle time. Met the 30 days target set by QA.\r\n\r\nPlease get the exact SLED RMA cases closed by PE from QA.	2020-12-02 06:55:16.78155+00	861437177	463
176	Upon receiving the task, xiaoyu was still relatively new in DSL, but he still went into details on the market report, and put in extra effort to search and consolidate BW information btw DSL and key competitors, which greatly helped the management team to see the super bandwidth opportunity in 1310nm wavelength range in OCT market.	2020-12-02 07:05:17.249601+00	861437177	465
177	Ronaldo joined DSL with strong test and programming background, which can greatly help DSL to enable a lot of test capability setup inhouse, test automation or semi-automation for UPH and cycle time improvement, as well as engineering work efficiency improve through many small scripts to speed up the data collection & compilation. \r\n\r\nTo make full use of his skillset, Ronaldo needs to establish a broader & long term view on how to integrate the scattered efforts from each function, and integrate them into a synchronized direction. This is one level higher than what he is supporting today.	2020-12-02 07:25:04.606489+00	861437177	460
178	Ronaldo's strength is the quick data pulling and consolidation, and ensure data accuracy. On this perspective, Ronaldo is probably the fastest among all PE engineers. However, his weakness is on putting up the data in a logical order with good story line. Many time, he tends to focus very much on one particular piece of data, and forget to let management team knows the big picturial view and how is that data link to this picture and direction. \r\n\r\nSecondly, on the low SMSR yield troubleshooting, Ronaldo has not yet shown his ability to deep dive into the grating profile to the SMSR yield. To do that, Ronaldo needs to expose more & learn the analytical skills in making correlation of test yield to Epi structure, Wafer fab process & parameters and x-SEM etc.	2020-12-02 07:50:07.848387+00	861437177	456
179	To enable the smooth transfer, Ronaldo needs to study through the phase gate meaning and checklist in details, understand the requirement to exit each phase gate, and define list of outstanding actions that NPD needs to close by each phase gate. Also, basic program management skill training has been provided to him to help him handle this project.	2020-12-02 07:58:08.992285+00	861437177	458
180	So far, Ronaldo is very open and readily to take up additional work load or adhoc job assignment on test setup and automation, and he can always help the team greatlly to get engineering test results in an efficient manner.	2020-12-02 08:20:21.446537+00	861437177	459

All technical internal audit has been carried out and helped NPD to process through Audit check.	2020-12-03 10:03:04.249536+00	539619816	448
193	ELED test yield is mainly dominated by unstable and high variation of ripple yield loss. Team was working in parallel on variation control by identifying toggling factors like test, ridge etch profile etc, as well as laser chip design optimization (by adopting the SLED absorber & tapered ridge design). Carlan was working proactively and diligently on both paths. He was also learning by OJT on process & design factors toggling ripple.	2020-12-07 06:58:38.901971+00	861437177	342
200	Despite the heavy work load & pressure to recover back ELED yield while Carlan newly took over from Hafiz in May, Carlan stayed very positive and showed strong sense of ownership on these NPD/NRE project. For 1650nm FP laser, two customers engaged, and 10 samples order received as of Dec'20.  For OSI, 1310nm bulk design passed the customer's power and back reflection spec, but 1550nm need to re-design the bulk Epi structure to meet the power spec	2020-12-09 02:50:39.881955+00	861437177	344
201	However, the “proactive” mindset still needs to enhance as part of working culture change needs for PE team especially on revenue support, as many times PE support were constrained by the mindset and way-of-working from PPC & supply chain (e.g the new epi growth needs, inventory status, PO status & gap, PE needs to proactively trigger PPC to share and make decision accordingly)	2020-12-09 02:52:43.683315+00	861437177	472
202	1. Something commendable about Carlan is his leadership potential. Through the training of new staff, Carlan demonstrated a very good coaching skills by explaining things in a logical order, and easy for others to understand & hands on. Carlan also has the potential to see big picture, and put his insights in sharing knowledge and project direction with his big pictorial view. \r\n2. Through the training to sales team, it can also see that Carlan did a lot of home work to package him with strong technical background and understanding on ELED and SLED.	2020-12-09 02:54:07.477871+00	861437177	473
203	Carlan is strong in data analysis and technical issue troubleshooting, and has been working extensively with MOCVD team and hafiz previously on SLED Epi structure optimization for Power/BW and yield improvement. He also worked aggressively on ELED chip design optimization for ripple baseline improvement. Carlan not only focus on data analysis, but would also deep dive into the technical background and mechanism to link or support the Epi or chip design improvement direction and test data validation. This is very good, and as he is gaining more & more experience and knowledge on design & process factors impact to test parameters, he will surely improve his efficiency on problem solving moving forward.	2020-12-09 02:55:09.731375+00	861437177	343

209	Despite the economy downturns. I have contributed to bring in $350k revenue to the company for winning the business with Polytech. \r\nThough this will not happen this year due to the long lead time of the components but its already a deliverables for next year.	2020-12-10 03:54:47.461394+00	1014312820	172
205	1. Being the previous owner for DFB 16xx, and also the original owner who drove the Almae yield from 20% to 70% level through the grating profile optimization, Zuhdi has taken up the SMSR yield improvement role again when he joined back DSL in Aug’20. \r\n2. His analytical skills and knowledge in opto-electronics has fully demonstrated in this assignment, and he can do technical deep diving, create logical link to the big data base, and is able to filter noise data and guide management team to the right direction for improvement. This is clearly a strong area I observed on Zuhdi. He should keep it up and utilize his strength in other job assignment on technical issue troubleshooting and data analysis.	2020-12-09 08:09:31.67883+00	861437177	351
194	1) Have shipped a number of BF9C box with linewidth lower than 50Khz for samples. NPD still working on the 10khz versions. \r\n\r\n2) For panwoo, we have actually packaged successful BTF units with AFR and sent samples to customer. Now we are in the optimization phase to get better yield wafers and to increase the power.	2020-12-07 07:05:36.261017+00	973701598	295

195	1. Baseline SoWs have all been generated. Approval processes in progress.\r\n2. Yields - 90% yields seen generally for high runner production parts. Yield for FBGL is fluactuting partly due to engineering uncertainties. SFO still has low yield in ILM boxes.\r\n3. CT improved to 3 weeks at Allray and 4 weeks at SFO. Coset is 4-5 weeks, PMS is >6 weeks due mostly to FBGL yield issues.\r\n4. Qualification is done. Yield is >90% based on small sample sizes.\r\n5. Hisense documentation and test correlation are ready however manufacturing has not started due to no sale of parts yet.\r\n6. AFR identified as alternative subcon for 8-pin and 14-p[in FBGL lasers and already used as supplier for engineering parts. Full qualification for production parts in-progress. ELED TO Can suppliers have not been found but put on-hold since Allray can support full volume at the moment.	2020-12-08 07:51:20.364508+00	50985924	173
196	- Except for 14-pin BTF narrow linewidth laser with isolator, all projects have been successful (they all have a working product).\r\n- New product development procedure for design and assembly at subcons has been established and agreed upon by NPD and PE groups.	2020-12-08 09:56:53.685547+00	50985924	174

199	1. Closed 3 RMAs with average 21 days cycle time. Met the 30 days target set by QA.\r\n2. Closed 7 NCMRs for ELED/SLED with average 77 days cycle time. Higher than 30 days target, but this is comparable to other department.\r\n3. Many of PE NCMR is low yield wafers, and yield target was set too high to trigger NCMR, PE has worked with QA to re-set the yield target to reflect the true yield performance & low yield triggering point.	2020-12-09 02:48:36.817507+00	861437177	471
211	KFA 1.3 All the activities as per planned every month went well.\r\n\r\nKFA 4.3 only involved in the planning phase and embark with other automation projects as aligned to i4.0 such as WO automation and Utilization tracking.	2020-12-10 05:08:43.162614+00	1014312820	165
213	1. Firstly, as one of the previous ILM Box owner, Zuhdi picked up very fast and rendered adequately good support to ensure the timely revenue shipment. Secondly, the ILM Box way of working and ownership is quite messy before NPD transfer ownership to PE. Despites the daily “surprises” here and there, Zuhdi is proactively taking up ownership to link up all broken pieces together to back fill the gaps.\r\n2. Overall, Zuhdi has the knowledge and deep diving ability on challenging technical issues. Moving forward, if Zuhdi can further improve in the ability to do multi-tasking, that will be even better for his own growth & development as well as creating more values to the PE team.	2020-12-10 05:15:11.322234+00	861437177	355
215	Internally, the plan to re-layout APT to support the revenue ramp has been completed . \r\nAs a result, it reduces the distance travelled by operator from one workstation to another by 56% as test and assembly are already in the same area. By using the IE tool such as relationship diagram the relevant/related workstations are shifted near with each other which is also a factor in improvement process.\r\nThe progress of adhering to the proposed layout is currently at 95% progress.	2020-12-10 05:19:57.763599+00	1014312820	167
216	1. There are still many unknown technical issues on NLW laser, COS to module process interaction, as well as COS & module to box assembly process interaction.\r\n2. Moving forward, in terms of PE resources, there is plan for another FBGL module/ILM box PE head count to be hired, and Zuhdi needs to coach and guide him/her on the ILM box related problem solving. The goal is to ultimately establish clear understanding on the various technical issues to ensure smooth production ramp, on time customer delivery and good quality products.	2020-12-10 05:32:20.982401+00	861437177	369
214	Had already fulfilled the required number of headcount in APT for 1H of 2020 based on the actual APT loading. However, in 2H onwards I am no longer directly involve in APT headcount.\r\nAlthough, I have built up a model to determine the number of headcount required based on demand/forecast which can help the supervisor to determine the requirement.	2020-12-10 05:15:27.617336+00	1014312820	177
217	With his data management background, Zuhdi hands on very fast after he re-joined back DSL. He has clear direction how to drive the individual database infrastructure, and bring all different blocks together. What he needs to learn moving forward is how to utilize higher management power to help him drive the work at the working level. It’s inevitably in a working place, many people need the top-down force to deliver tasks, especially areas not in their priority. It’s part of self-growing process that Zuhdi needs to learn.	2020-12-10 06:18:41.376446+00	861437177	354
218	Again, with Zuhdi’s knowledge and experience in data management system, and in particular his past experience in partnering with Pointstar, Zuhdi contributed valuable inputs to guide the management team to negotiate on the software deliverables and make the right decision. Project was delayed few months due to some server migration issue at the vendor side, and now is back on track to launch by end of 2020.	2020-12-10 06:33:29.839404+00	861437177	353
219	So far only one internal working meeting between Zuhdi and other PE engineers to deep dive into the simulation tool, need mid-long term plan to slowly establish the simulation capability within PE team. If need external support, let's put down the requirements as well.	2020-12-10 06:37:47.211541+00	861437177	357

243	Clean process with SRD shows good results for epi regrowth. However, need to work on solution for non-full wafers or wafers with cracks that cannot use SRD.\r\n\r\nWet etch process uniformity and repeatability is still a challenge. Will need to evaluate new etch recipe with Br2.\r\n\r\nEngineering mask with different biases and designs have been tapeout for BH (Octans, Sika)	2020-12-14 02:39:49.890716+00	439847763	61
242	Simon has provided support in running multiple wafers requested from the program. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, PCO attack from Trion SiON has resulted in inconsistent wafer quality. However, he has done well in compiling the data on PCO attack.	2020-12-14 02:34:10.926888+00	439847763	64
241	Santosh has qualified flow for 25G. Progress has been made to localised passivation which is being implemented as the new POR for i-temp. \r\n\r\nExperiments for current blocking and reverse ridge have been supported but put on hold as they may not be required. No requirements on FC for now.	2020-12-14 02:30:11.298282+00	439847763	63

244	Need to work on this aspect more, especially on window checks. Several problems in the line now are due to process/equipment variability that are failing due to lack of process margin (e.g. nodules, SiON delamination).	2020-12-14 02:43:09.293778+00	439847763	69
245	Simon has provided support in running wafers requested by the program.\r\n\r\nNo requirements to run FC yet.	2020-12-14 02:46:01.207785+00	439847763	65
246	Simon has provided support in running the 3" wafers. Main delays have been from scheduling priority. Most 3" processing completed except for final obstacles on 3" RTP. Work on 3" plating (not required for current wafer) is also still ongoing.	2020-12-14 02:50:21.158908+00	439847763	66
247	Need to finalise and work with module team on training materials, especially due to high turnover rate. Will work together with updating documents for ISO.	2020-12-14 02:52:13.903989+00	439847763	67
248	Simon has worked well with Rebecca to implement features in DMES required for supporting engineering wafers. There are still some minor bugs that need to be ironed out but DMES is now being used for all production wafers and most engineering wafers.	2020-12-14 02:55:32.445902+00	439847763	68
249	Some initial discussions have been done with Santosh and Simon. No progress so far.	2020-12-14 02:58:11.862395+00	439847763	70
250	Santosh has supported runsheet creation of multiple flows and masksets requested from POET. Need to work with him to check process margins which had led to issues such as HME over etch and plating nodules/horns.	2020-12-14 03:05:13.515038+00	439847763	62

220	Done research and benchmarking on other renowned semiconductor companies around the globe to understand and more importantly, execute the Kaizen projects with results. \r\nThe mainframe has been created and presented to management during the Operational Excellence reviews. However, due to lack of intern or a 3rd headcount to establish and ensure continuity of this system, the project was placed on hold. There was no or very low application for an IE internship when it was posted. Next steps was to build a Job Description for a full time junior IE/IT role. The justification for this needs more thoughts to fill up the executive time fruitfully for 40-45 hrs a work week, and building more projects to accommodate this will be the key next step.\r\n                                              \r\nKFA 4.1 - WIP management thru ODOO was a success story and though there are many nicks along the way, it was overcame diligently. This road to fully cross between APT (Assy) to Fab B (Coating) back to APT (Assy and Test) right thru SubCon and back again to APT in various product form takes time to be developed inside the Odoo system. Traveller sheet has been re-designed, the sun-con invoice details is underway plus a few more milestones needs to be established before this goes life. A lot of time and resources has been used as a concerted effort to get this going, and once system wise ready, the journey will be to internalize the the new way of going things which is inline with the i4.0 where productivity thru automation replaces manual way of executing non value added jobs. \r\n\r\nKFA4.3 - Led by Nee Shiuan and he's on track with all his automation projects which by and large needs the expertise of PE\r\n\r\nBi Weekly Meeting has been setup with the President and CEO with the Head of Supply Chain to run thru the key projects and the deliverables in line with the company's objectives.	2020-12-10 06:55:01.810857+00	1982477965	298
225	Several charts has been created using limited data we had initially to build an APT WIP profile thru Odoo automation as a mini ERP system. This is not only limited to WIP profile, but also as aging WIP, Queue time pareto by tool type, and many other customizable charts and trends for analysis.\r\n\r\nTraveler has has been added into Odoo as opposed to hard copy. Invoicing thru Odoo for sub con and tracking is currently underway. \r\n\r\nSo far, the ODOO system is a working solution but is only 65%-70% completed. This journey will be part of a continuous improvement item where the sky will be the limit as new and improved solutions becomes available over time. The last 15%-20% will be the toughest as it will link up the overall structure from W/O release till shipment and linking materials and sub-con as a whole WIP management solution,	2020-12-10 08:22:10.794233+00	1982477965	297

252	As the key person building up PE database, Jaslyn's main focus was on improving the timeliness of ELED/SLED database in TIBCO, as this is extremely important to enable real time product test issue troubleshooting and engineering data characterization and analysis. For this project, Jaslyn is supporting Carlan on the Autobar station database enhancement. Moving forward, Jaslyn should take more initiative to understand the database needs from PE end users (all the product owners), and come out strategical plan to improve database integrity and timeliness. She should also work proactively to drive other functions (like APT) to improve data accuracy & speed on data readiness in TIBCO.	2020-12-14 04:53:25.485394+00	861437177	136
253	Jaslyn is new to yield reporting system and yield management system. For 2020, Jacquelyn was leading the effort to establish ELED, SLED process flow, established & aligned the integral yield calculation model, and guidelines on managing the yield  data, while Jaslyn is supporting Jacquelyn to pull the data, follow the yield model to do weekly yield reporting. Moving forward in 2021, as Jaslyn is now familiar with the yield management system concept, she needs to put more thought process, and give her insights how to improve the yield reporting system, and strategy to incorporate more new products going to release into production next year.	2020-12-14 05:35:41.35416+00	861437177	137
254	Again Jaslyn is new to the yield management & yield dashboard. Main effort led by Jacquelyn with the rest of PE and Subbu to establish the yield dashboard template. As Jaslyn holds a role on PE data management system/improvement, her role is critical and also linked tightly with the yield reporting & management. Therefore, the expection to her is to demonstrate more initiative & drive to contribute on the strategical plan and road map on yield management system moving forward. Today, she is working as a supporting role mainly.	2020-12-14 06:05:39.727781+00	861437177	482
255	I would say from Q1-Q3’20, PE product engineers were still struggling pretty much to ask for “case-by-case” basis on the data readiness in TIBCO for weekly yield analysis, engineering DOE and issue troubleshooting, as there are weeks delay on the data readiness in TIBCO. Situation improved in earlier Q4’20 with more structural way to review and highlight the gaps in database system. Now the data readiness gap improved to be within 24hrs.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, expectation for Jaslyn as the key person on data management system, needs to drive the database gap by proactively working with PE product owners, understand the big pictorial view of database future direction, and come out breakthrough ideas, improvement plan and drive all parties to bring the whole database system to the next level.	2020-12-14 06:32:58.002001+00	861437177	483

300	1. ELED: overall CBT test yield capability improved by ~5% looking at the monthly trend from 2019 to 2020: best yielding month is at 72.1%, while the best yield month for 2020 is at 77.3%; However the yield is not stable mainly due to poor design margin for ripple. Yield trended low in Q1 and Q3, and managed to recover back to ~75% level in Q4’20. \r\n\r\n1.1\t By quarter performance:\r\n•\tQ1 = 13 wafers (27,765 dies) tested, avg yield = 65.1%\r\n•\tQ2 = 17 wafers (28, 753 dies) tested, avg yiled = 77.7%\r\n•\tQ3 = 18 wafers (24,716 dies) tested, avg yield = 71.5%\r\n•\tQ4 QTD: 20 wafers tested avg yield = 75.2%\r\n•\tQ4 met the 75% ELED/SLED cum yield target with ELED yield on 53084H/3036H normalized to 54708T.\r\n\r\n1.2 Record yield:\r\n1. Record yielding wafer is 20023B with 87% CBT test yield from Samco etcher in Q3.\r\n2. Record yielding week is wk17 at 84.1% with 2829 dies tested.\r\n3. Stably recovered the ELED CBT test yield back to 79.6% after flushing out Oxford & tester issue with total 5351 dies tested.\r\n\r\n1.3\tNo record of mis-shipment for first half of 2020.\r\n\r\n2.\tSLED: \r\n•\tQ1: CBT: 50.1%/COS: 85.1% -> CBT*COS: 42.6%: CBT (14 wfrs); COS: (19 wfrs)\r\n•\tQ2: CBT: 89.3%/COS:91.5% -> CBT*COS: 81.7%: CBT (11 wfrs); COS: (17 wfrs)\r\n•\tQ3: CBT: 82.8%/COS:79..5% -> CBT*COS: 65.8%: CBT (5 wfrs); COS: (13 wfrs)\r\n\r\n2.1 Not meeting yield target of 87.5% (CBT*COS). To meet the yield goal Need further improvement on power and bandwidth on weaker products and flushing out the old low yield wafers. \r\n2.2 The quarter to quarter yield variation comes from different products loading with different yield capability. \r\n2.3 Yield improvement plan:\r\n- CS5153A family: bandwidth improvement through SCH thin down from 50nm to 40nm; lead wafer on 5153A new Epi QW design showed promising BW & power results meeting the product spec. \r\n- CS68M5A: key challenge is to hit the +/-10nm wavelength range, while no capability current at this wavelength range to measure PL. Started 3 wafers with PL, PL+10nm, PL-10nm to enable cherry pick units for this +/-10nm wavelength spec. \r\n-  CS5169A family: latest wafer (20041A) copied the golden wafer (19070A) EPI scheme, but power still fail, and is likely related to wafer broken (20041A) and Samco etcher (30% lower power compared to Oxford), need to monitor more wafer.\r\n- Wavelength centering CS68M5A, first wafer 16086A PL off target >15nm, fine tuning for potential requirement.\r\n- CS 5169A-FA: need to grow new epi wafer with 45nm SCH (to improve power) + wavelength centering.\r\n- CS3504A/CS3452A family: grown new Epi wafer based on golden wafer 14069A Epi scheme. Pending test results.\r\n\r\n3. DFB16xx: no production volume on DFB16xx as sales has yet to engage any successful customers yet. Overall, total 8 wafers tested for Q1~Q3, overall average yield is 38.6%. Excluding one wafer hit by RTP excursion, the average yield is 43.1%.\r\n• Almae: 3 wafers (excluding RTP affected wafer) is at 49%\r\n• Eulitha: 4 wafers is at 38.8%.\r\nDidn't meet the yield target for both Almae and Eulitha. However, direction is clear to further improve the SMSR yield. Pending lead wafer on 20nm grating thickness to confirm.  \r\n\r\nNew technical learnings/breakthrough:\r\n• Almae: altogether 3 wafers with optimum grating design (30nm grating height) yielded ~69% in average from Q2 & Q3. Yield is very consistent.\r\n• Eulitha: so far only two wafers tested, best yielding wafer is at 63% with 30nm grating height. Expect yield will be even better with 20nm Grating height by Q4. \r\n• Established the correlation of Kappa-L to SMSR yield with Kappa-L > 3, SMSR yield will drop to below 40% level. Waiting for more data out to establish the Kappa-L sweet spot.  \r\n• Established capability & automate the multi-current SMSR testing.  \r\n• Established testing methodology for bar test and packaged TOCAN with TEC	2020-12-15 07:31:00.053368+00	861437177	28

555	Completed all 8 rounds of KFA5.4 presentations with following :\r\n1)\tLeading KFA5.4 team on the discussions of strategic initiative for InP-PIC  \r\n2)\tProvided SWOT analysis of various technical approaches to Photonic Integration.\r\n3)\tEvaluated DLS readiness for InP-PIC using EML as a product vehicle\r\n4)\tProvided the EML development strategy to achieve technology development of EML.	2021-01-13 06:51:58.430658+00	1602769597	257
548	1) We still need to work on reducing holds once we run more wafers and move towards production transfer. DMES conversion has been done well. In the future, DMES templates need to be prepared early and tested if possible to reduce potential delays during execution.\r\n2) Runsheet remarks are good. We can improve communication with module engineers in advance before the wafer reaches the hold. Some form of FMEA or risk mitigation may be good to prevent situations where rework is required.\r\n3) We should expedite this as eBeam cost are quite significant.	2021-01-13 03:48:58.787664+00	439847763	122
550	A lot of good effort have been made and many issues have been resolved so far. Let us ensure we do sufficient margin checks so that there is no recurrence.\r\nUnfortunately, there have been too many issues affecting wafer yield and scrap. New issues are always occurring before we can solve the current one. We need to work with module team to prevent and reduce issues from occurring in the first place.	2021-01-13 04:20:59.795384+00	439847763	121
551	Continue the good work. Louie and Simon have been trained up quite well.	2021-01-13 04:34:17.856822+00	439847763	123
552	Runsheet support for backup tool is good. We need to support module team to qualify and improve capabilities of the backup tools.	2021-01-13 05:05:08.89148+00	439847763	120
553	Good support on SLED production maintenance. Most issues arise from implementation of backup tools for process (e.g. Trion SiON, SAMCO etch). We need to support module team on their backup tool qualification and still maintain strict standards on what is released to our production flow.	2021-01-13 06:50:07.857386+00	439847763	200
574	Aayush has met the expectations under supervision for the Testing activities listed above. The next step for him will be to continue developing his experimental skills and ability to improve existing setups and propose new ones. The simulation part was left unachieved unfortunately.\r\nRegarding the work done on NCMR, the conclusion that kinks are not related to mode-hops is counter-intuitive and goes against observations made by other DLS engineers. A final report with clear statements is still pending.	2021-01-16 15:43:29.758236+00	1557152765	499

558	Great job on SOA program so far. Be prepared to work on developing Flip Chip and Mode Field Adapter process flows when required. We will likely start with CANOPUS flow for AMF and expand to other programs such as the SOA. Let's target to get first time pass (no major fab process issue) for new process flow development.	2021-01-13 07:16:50.972408+00	439847763	188

561	Good work on catching and bringing up issues on MQW undulations to the team. We need to continue to provide consistent processing of wafers, especially on projects like Panwoo where there are multiple DOEs on epistack design, so that meaningful conclusions can be made.	2021-01-13 07:32:44.343775+00	439847763	187
562	Good execution on 3" conversion so far. We need to work with Module and Equipment team to get 3" wafer plating ready.	2021-01-13 07:38:00.280863+00	439847763	203
563	There have been many process issues affecting the line. Although we have mostly reacted quickly to resolve them, there is still significant yield loss and wafer scrap. We need to gather our experiences into a blue book and start working on preventive measures to improve our CONC.	2021-01-13 07:45:33.679348+00	439847763	205
